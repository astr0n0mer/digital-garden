## Expose local [[frappe]] bench to the internet
	- Used [[ngrok]] to expose a custom localhost to the internet
	  ```bash
	  ngrok http http://development.localhost:8000 --host-header="development.localhost:8000"
	  ```
	  For some reason, the above command got me and Allan blocked from ngrok
	- Stumbled upon [awesome-tunneling](https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling) while trying to find [[ngrok]] alternatives
	- Used [[localtunnel]] as [[ngrok]] replacement for now
	  ```bash
	  npx localtunnel -l development.localhost -p 8000
	  ```
- ## Create radar/spider chart
	- Saw some examples of radar/spider chart being created using [[plotly]] and [[pygal]]
