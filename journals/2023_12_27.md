	- could not start `screen` sessions in detached mode when using `.screenrc` file as `-d` option was not allowed in `screenrc` file.
	  so a session with `syncthing` running would take up the current terminal and I wouldn't be able to push it to background jobs
	- Instead I now use `screen -dmS syncthing syncthing` to start `syncthing` in detached mode
