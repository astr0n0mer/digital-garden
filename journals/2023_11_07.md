- Used `bench backup` and `bench restore` commands to create dummy datasets in frappe bench
- Steps:
	- Import data into Frappe
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Create site backup
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- ```bash
		  bench --site source.localhost backup *\[path_to_sql_backup_file\]*
		  ```
	- Restore site backup
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- ```bash
		  bench --site destination.localhost restore *path_to_sql_backup_file* --force
		  # MySQL root password: 123
		  ```
- Notes:
	- Any apps present while taking the backup should be present when you're restoring the backup
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Need to see what happens if I do not have the other apps that are present in source but not in destination localhost
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
