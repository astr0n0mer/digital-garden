DONE check if writing `public:: true` after any block affects whether blocks before it are published in [[Logseq]] graph

	- Block `public:: true` has effect on the page level and not on block level, so can't define blocks as public true/false
	- [Set a selection of pages in All Pages as public or private](https://discuss.logseq.com/t/set-a-selection-of-pages-in-all-pages-as-public-or-private/4246)
- DONE create a [Slack Canvas](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/help/articles/203950418-Use-a-canvas-in-Slack) for tracking project stuff #Slack/Canvas
