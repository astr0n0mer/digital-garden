- Review
	- I've used git bare repository to manage my dotfiles for almost a year, and it worked great
	- I'm now switching to using GNU Stow for this due the following reasons:
		- Doing git operations is painful since your `GIR_WORK_DIR` is `$HOME` which makes some code editors lag a bit when indexing your entire `$HOME` dir.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Fuzzy finding for things directly in `$HOME` is slow as well
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Dotfiles are scattered around as the system/applications place them, GNU Stow will allow me to have more control on file placement
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
